heyy hii,  you no need to go through readme files everytime ,you can directly go through labs because each and every project i did ,,i have put it in steps so no worries.....
If u want any info : only thing that you need is tools i have used : 1.command prompt
                                                                     2.console
 so go through the labs  directly and i will upload the images of it later because i need to group the images and upload so take little time.
