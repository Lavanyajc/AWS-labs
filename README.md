heyy hii,  you no need to go through readme files everytime ,you can directly go through labs because each and every project i did ,,i have put it in steps so no worries.....

#If u want any info : only thing that you need to know  is tools i have used : 
1.command prompt(cli commands)
2.console

So go through the labs  directly and i will upload the images of it later because i need to group the images and upload so take little time.
