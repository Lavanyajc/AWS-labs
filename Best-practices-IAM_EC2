# IAM & EC2 Lab – Policy Attachment Guidelines


1. Create Users & Groups
   - ❌ No policies attached initially

2. Attach & Detach Policies
   - ✅ Attach policies like:
     - AmazonS3FullAccess
     - AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess
   - ✅ Detach and test again

3. Permission Boundary
   - ✅ Attach a custom boundary policy with "Deny" or limited "Allow"

4. MFA Setup
   - ❌ No extra policies (done via Console)

5. Cross-User Access Denial
   - ✅ Attach inline policy to deny access to other users

6. Describe EC2 (CLI)
   - ✅ AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess

7. Block EC2 with Deny
   - ✅ Add explicit Deny policy to override any existing Allow

8. Test EC2 Actions with IAM
   - ✅ Use mix of Allow and Deny policies

9. S3 Upload/Download (CLI)
   - ✅ AmazonS3FullAccess (or custom with "s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject")


###so what are the best practices that we have  used in these projects or labs###
## ✅ IAM Best Practices Used

- ✅ Created IAM **users** and assigned them to **groups** for role-based access.
- ✅ Attached **policies to groups**, not individual users.
- ✅ Practiced **least privilege** by testing permission boundaries to restrict excess access.
- ✅ Used **inline policies** and then **detached** them for cleanup.
- ✅ Denied access intentionally using **explicit deny policies** to test secure configurations.
- ✅ Tested **cross-user access restriction** by simulating UserA and UserB permissions.
- ✅ Verified access via **AWS CLI** to ensure policies are working as intended.
- ✅ Configured **MFA** for IAM user login to improve account security.

## 💻 EC2 Best Practices Used

- ✅ Launched EC2 instances using **console** and connected using **CLI** for better control.
- ✅ Attached **IAM roles** to EC2 instances instead of using access keys.
- ✅ Described instances using **CLI** to manage and inspect resources.
- ✅ Applied **deny policies** to restrict EC2 actions from unauthorized users.
- ✅ Verified **least privilege** by testing user-specific access to EC2 resources.
- ✅ Managed EC2 access using **tags**, roles, and permissions.

## 📦 S3 Best Practices Used

- ✅ Uploaded and downloaded files via **CLI** to simulate real-world automation scenarios.
- ✅ Verified CLI access with IAM user policies to ensure **controlled access**.
- ✅ Ensured only **authorized users** could access S3 buckets/objects.
- ✅ Followed **least privilege** principle in S3 permissions using IAM policies.
