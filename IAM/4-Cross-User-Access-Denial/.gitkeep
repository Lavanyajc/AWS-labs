### üìÅ Lab: Cross-User Access Denial (UserA Denied Access to jc's S3 Bucket)

#### üë£ Steps Performed:

1. **Created 2 IAM Users**:  
   - `UserA`  
   - `jc`  

2. **Created an S3 Bucket**:  
   - Bucket name: `jc11`  
   - Created by user `jc`

3. **Uploaded a File to S3 Bucket**:  
   - File: `testfile.txt` with content: `"hello, aws!"`  
   - Uploaded via `jc` account

4. **Tested Cross-Access by Switching to UserA**:
   - Used CLI with `UserA` credentials  
   - Ran command:  
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp s3://jc11/testfile.txt testfile_downloaded.txt
     ```
   - ‚úÖ Got **Access Denied** (expected)

5. **Why Access Denied?**  
   - No S3 bucket policy allowed UserA  
   - IAM policy did not permit UserA to access `jc11`

6. 
   - By default, **S3 buckets are private**, and IAM users can't access each other's resources unless explicitly granted.
