 # IAM Lab 3: Set Permissions Boundary for IAM User

## ✅ Tasks Performed:

### 1. Created Custom Permissions Boundary Policy:
Policy Name: IAM-Boundary-EC2  
Action: ec2:DescribeInstances  
Effect: Allow

##json

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowEC2ActionsOnly",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}


### 2. Attached Permissions Boundary to `practice-user`:
aws iam put-user-permissions-boundary --user-name practice-user --permissions-boundary arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/IAM-Boundary-EC2

### 3. Verified Boundaries:
aws iam get-user --user-name practice-user  
# Confirmed that PermissionsBoundary was attached.

### 4. Tested Permissions:
aws ec2 describe-instances  ✅ Worked
aws iam list-users ❌ Access Denied (not allowed by boundary)

### 5. Removed Permissions Boundary:
aws iam delete-user-permissions-boundary --user-name practice-user //or use console

---

##  Outcome:
- Learned how Permissions Boundaries restrict user permissions.
- Saw the difference between policies and boundaries using CLI experiments.
