 
‚úÖ Lab: Attach and Detach IAM Policies (Console + CLI)

üî∏ Goal:
To test how attaching and detaching IAM policies affects an IAM user's ability to perform actions using the AWS CLI.

‚úÖ Steps Performed:

1. Created IAM User (UserA)
- Used AWS Console to create 'UserA'.
- Enabled Programmatic access.
- Downloaded access key & secret credentials.

2. Tested Without Permissions
- Configured AWS CLI with UserA credentials:
    aws configure
- Ran the command:
    aws ec2 describe-instances
- ‚ùå Got 'AccessDenied' error because no policy was attached.

3. Attached ReadOnly Policy
- Went to IAM Console > UserA > Permissions.
- Attached policy: AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess.
- Re-ran:
    aws ec2 describe-instances
- ‚úÖ Successfully listed EC2 instances.

4. Detached Policy
- In the console, detached the same policy.
- Re-tested with CLI:
    aws ec2 describe-instances
- ‚ùå Again received 'AccessDenied' error.
